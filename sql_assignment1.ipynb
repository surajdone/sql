    "A primary key is a unique identifier for each record (row) in a database table. It ensures that each record within the table is uniquely identified and can be used to distinguish one record from another. The primary key enforces data integrity and provides a way to uniquely identify records for retrieval, modification, and deletion.\n",
    "A foreign key establishes a relationship between two tables by referencing the primary key of another table. It creates a link between data in two tables, allowing data to be retrieved and manipulated based on the relationship between the tables. The foreign key represents a column or a set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key in another table.\n",
